IMPORTANT: Install rxjs-compat
Section 5, Lecture 58
As explained in the last video, you could theoretically NOT use rxjs-compat  and update all your RxJS-related code (imports + operator usage) as explained.

BUT Angularfire wasn't updated to support RxJS 6 yet. And since we'll use Angularfire in this course, you will need rxjs-compat  installed for the time being

=> npm install --save rxjs-compat
